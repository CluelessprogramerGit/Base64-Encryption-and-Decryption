# Simple Base64 Encryption and Decryption

This project contains two separate Python programs
-

Encryption Program: Encrypts plain text using Base64 encoding.

Decryption Program: Decrypts Base64-encoded files back to plain text.

How it Works
-
Base64 Encoding: This is a method of encoding binary data into ASCII characters.
It is commonly used to encode data in a format suitable for transfer through text-based protocols.

Encryption Program: Takes input as plain text and encodes it into Base64 format.

Decryption Program: Reads a Base64-encoded file and decodes it back to its original plain text.

Files Included
-

encrypt.py – A program to encrypt a plain text file into Base64.

decrypt.py – A program to decrypt a Base64-encoded file back into plain text.

Requirements
-

-Python 3.x

-No additional libraries are required, as Base64  encoding/decoding is supported by Python’s built-in library.
